Work with OSM Street Map Data for Flightgear

This is a collection point for a personal project to work with Rick Vanosten's materials.

https://gitlab.com/osm2city/osm2gear

The only materials here support the creation of a DEV0 environment for doing the work.

This includes: 
A top-level directory and sub-directories for each of Rick's projects, personal scripts for building, compiling, and running, based on any provided in any of Rick's projects.

More information on the DEV0 project can be found at
